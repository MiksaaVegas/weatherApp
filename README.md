# Web application for weather info (v1.1)

## Description
It's a simple JavaScript made web application that shows the current weather. The main purpose is to prove my skills for working with APIs. For now, can only show the weather for my city only, but a feature to see weather info  for every city will be added. 

## Features
- Nice and modern, yet simple visual and **responsive** design, with wide variation of backgrounds for all screen sizes from phones up to 4K resolution monitors.
- **73 different icons** used for visual representation on the weather and temperature.
- The weather info that is displayed includes wind speed, cloudiness and humidity.
- High level of optimisation, which results in faster loading speed.

#### Upcoming (To Do List)
- Selection for more metric units.
- Option to search for a location.
- Automatically allocating the user and give information for that location.

## Credit
I feel very satisfied by the free icons [UI Fresh](https://uifresh.net/store/uifresh/) & [svgrepo.com](svgrepo.com) offer! There was no attribution required on the liecense of their products, but i want to credit them because they made the whole product look soo much better, and I am very happy with the results.
